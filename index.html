				<h2>Gothic Art</h2>
				<em>1150-1600</em>
        <p>Gothic art is one type of Medieval art that characterized the 12th century and lasted until the start of the 17th century. The movement started in France and grew out of the rule of the Roman Catholic Church. Because many people were illiterate at the time, Gothic art and other types of Medieval art used consistent symbols and typology to convey the stories and ideas of the church. Art was almost strictly commissioned for and by the church and took the form of frescoes, sculptures, illuminated manuscripts, stained glass, and altarpieces. </p>

      <em>1400-1700</em>
      <p>
      The Renaissance, which means "rebirth," marked a new interest in classical Greak mythology and scholarship. The influence of humanism as a cultural movement is evident in the art that was created throughout the period as subject matter shifted from Biblical stories to the perfection of the human body and mind. The movement started in Italy but also flourished beyond its origin in Florence.

The work produced in this period reflects a cultural shift toward apoliticism, nihilism and experience. The name encompasses a large number of artists who largely have their own unrelated styles. Unlike in prior periods of art, Abstract Expressionism was just as much about the artist himself as the viewer and anticipated audience.
