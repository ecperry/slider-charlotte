  <h2>Renaissance</h2>
      <em>1400-1700</em>
      <p>
      The Renaissance, which means "rebirth," marked a new interest in classical Greak mythology and scholarship. The influence of humanism as a cultural movement is evident in the art that was created throughout the period as subject matter shifted from Biblical stories to the perfection of the human body and mind. The movement started in Italy but also flourished beyond its origin in Florence.

  	This French art movement marked a break from traditional methods and the start of modern art. At the time, the impressionists were criticized for not painting things as they looked. The impressionists were more concerned with depicting light, human perception and the passing of time than accuracy.

    			This movement puts emphasis on the process of creating the work almost more than the work itself. It began and flourished in post-WWII New York. The work produced in this period reflects a cultural shift toward apoliticism, nihilism and experience. The name encompasses a large number of artists who largely have their own unrelated styles. Unlike in prior periods of art, Abstract Expressionism was just as much about the artist himself as the viewer and anticipated audience.
